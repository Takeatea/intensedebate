== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is data synchronization? =

Comments made in IntenseDebate are automatically backed-up to your WordPress comment system, while your existing WordPress comments are automatically imported into IntenseDebate. You always have all of your comments so uninstalling is a one-click process if you change your mind. Syncing your accounts enables auto-login so logging into WordPress automatically logs you into IntenseDebate. Profile sync also means that comments you make are synchronized to both profiles so you maintain ownership of your profile.

= What about SEO? =

IntenseDebate outputs the standard WordPress comments enabling your comments to still be indexed by search engines that ignore JavaScript, while ensuring that visitors surfing with JavaScript disabled will be able to interact with comments made in IntenseDebate. Readers with JS disabled can comment in the original WP system and those comments will be imported into IntenseDebate.

= How do I use my OpenID? = 

While you can use your OpenID to login and signup with IntenseDebate, using your OpenID to synchronize IntenseDebate and WordPress accounts is not currently supported.

If you created your account using your OpenID you will need to access your IntenseDebate username and userkey. Your username and user key will allow you to sync your accounts. You will need to be logged into IntenseDebate in order to access your username and [user key](http://intensedebate.com/userkey).

= How do I sync my accounts? = 
After installing and activating the IntenseDebate plugin you will need to update your account settings in your Plugin Settings page and either create an IntenseDebate account or login to your IntenseDebate account. Your data synchronization and comment import will start as soon as you have successfully logged in.

**Please Note:**
Your comments may take several hours to import. The time of your import is dependent on how many other import requests we are receiving in addition to how many comments are currently being imported.
